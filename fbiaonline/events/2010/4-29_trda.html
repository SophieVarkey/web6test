<div align="center"><strong>TRDA HOSTS 7 STATEWIDE SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH GRANT  WORKSHOPS FROM APRIL TO SEPTEMBER</strong></div>
  MELBOURNE, Fla. (March 25, 2010) - Small businesses receive more than $2 billion    in federal grants and contracts each year through the Small Business Innovation    Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs - but the    road to receiving this funding is filled with competition.
  Florida's Technological Research and Development Authority (TRDA) understands that    small business owners need this funding and works to help them receive it. Continuing    its assistance, TRDA has put together seven workshops around the state featuring the    best SBIR trainers in the business.
  The workshops will occur between April and September and will feature nationally    renowned SBIR trainers: Mark Henry (president of Grow Emerging Companies in    Colorado), Jim Greenwood (president of Greenwood Consulting Group in Sanibel Island)    and Sharon Ballard (president of Enable Ventures in Arizona).
  &quot;Florida has some of the brightest entrepreneurs across the nation, and TRDA strongly    believes in helping these company's get the funding they need to make a difference in    their respective sectors,&quot; said Chester Straub, TRDA executive director. &quot;These    workshops will be the invaluable to small business owners working to achieve that goal.&quot;
  The schedule of events and locations is as follows:<br />
    <strong>April 29</strong> - Melbourne (TRDA Business Innovation Center, 1050 West NASA Blvd.)<br />
    <strong>May 4</strong> - Jacksonville (University of North Florida University Center, 12000 Alumni Dr.)<br />
    <strong>June 3</strong> - Miami (University of Miami in Coral Gables)<br />
    <strong>June 10</strong> - Tallahassee (National High Magnetic Field Lab at Innovation Park, 1800 E.    Paul Dirac Dr.)<br />
    <strong>July 15</strong> - Largo (Star Technology Enterprise Center, 7887 Bryan Dairy Rd.)<br />
    <strong>August 4</strong> - Orlando (Disney Entrepreneur Center, 315 E. Robinson St., Suite 100)<br />
    <strong>September 16</strong> - Boca Raton (Enterprise Development Corp. Technology Business    Incubator at FAU, 3701 FAU Blvd ., Suite 201)
  The workshops are scheduled to run from 8 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The cost is $49 per    person, per workshop and includes lunch. Space is limited, so interested parties must    register online at TRDA.org (recommended) or contact Bonnie O'Regan at <a href="mailto:    boregan@trda.org">boregan@trda.org</a> or 321 .872.1050, Ext. 107.
