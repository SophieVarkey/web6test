  <h2 align="left">FBIA's Mission:</h2>
  <p align="left" class="h4"> Empowering Incubators  Statewide to Launch the Business of Tomorrow
  <ul>
    <li>If you're an entrepreneur, a business  incubator can be a lifesaver! </li>
    <li>Incubators and Accelerators help  entrepreneurs transform their dreams into reality.</li>
    <li> Incubators support the successful launch and  operation of early stage businesses. But, what if you operate the incubator?  &nbsp;Who is looking out for <em><strong>you</strong></em><strong> </strong>and empowering<strong> <em>you</em></strong> with access to the tools and resources<strong><em> you</em></strong> need to make your  incubator skyrocket to success?      </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left"><strong>The Florida Business
    Incubation Association (FBIA) is here to serve <em>YOU</em></strong>
  <p align="left">Established in October 1998, the FBIA shares information and  develops programs that support the successful growth and operation of business  incubators throughout Florida. Specifically, the Association fulfills this  mission through several key initiatives:   
<ul type="disc">
      <li>
        <strong>Statewide Peer-to-Peer Meetings &nbsp;-</strong> &nbsp;The FBIA hosts numerous meetings for its members  throughout the year plus the Annual Conference. These gatherings present great  opportunities for the incubator employees to network and share ideas. <br />
        
       </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Program Development &nbsp;-</strong>The FBIA plays an integral role in identifying  and developing programs that help you provide greater service to your incubator  clients. </li>
      
      <li><strong>Unified Voice &nbsp;-</strong> &nbsp;Through the FBIA, statewide incubators have one,  centralized mechanism to &lsquo;speak as one&rsquo;. &nbsp;The Association serves as  &quot;sounding board&quot; for its members, who can share their concerns, needs  and goals in order to maximize their effectiveness.</li>
      <li><strong>National Affiliation &ndash;</strong> FBIA teams up with the International Business Innovation Association, InBIA, to award conference scholarship opportunities to the       FBIA members.</li></ul>
  As a member of the FBIA, you will reap the rewards of this fantastic networking
  and career-enhancing opportunity. Furthermore, you will enjoy reduced
  conference fees and access to incubator management training workshops
  to keep you current in your profession.
