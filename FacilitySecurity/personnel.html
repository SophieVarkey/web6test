  <h1>Personnel Security  </h1>
  <p>UCF Office of Facility Security assists  with all aspects of obtaining, maintaining, and terminating personnel security  clearances.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>Obtaining Personnel Security Clearance</strong></h3>
  <p> Working on a contract issued by a  branch of the United States Government or another defense contractor, and it is  determined that access to classified information is essential in the  performance of your duties on the contract, you may be required to obtain a  personnel security clearance. </p>
  <h3><strong>Security of Classified Information</strong></h3>
  <p> The term &quot;classified&quot; applies to information that the Government has  determined <strong>&quot;requires protection in the interest of National  Security&quot;</strong>. If you require access to classified information or  material, the following definitions are important:</p>
  <p><strong><em>Levels  of Classified Information</em></strong></p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Top Secret:</strong> The highest       classification level applies to information whose unauthorized disclosure       could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to       National Security.</li>
    <li><strong>Secret:</strong> The       classification level between Confidential and Top Secret that applies to       information whose unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to       cause serious damage to National Security.</li>
    <li><strong>Confidential:</strong> The lowest       classification level applies to information whose unauthorized disclosure       would reasonably be expected to cause identifiable damage to the National       Security.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If  you have questions about the Personnel Security, please contact the Facility  Security Officer.<u> </u></p>
  <h3><strong>Initial Security Clearance</strong></h3>
  <p> Never held a personnel security  clearance before, or if your previous clearance was terminated more than  twenty-four (24) months ago, the following items are needed in order to process  your request for a personnel security clearance:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><a href="http://resadmin.uah.edu/rsa/docs/JustificationForPersonnelSecurityClearance.pdf">Justification for Personnel Security Clearance</a></li>
    <li>Proof of U.S. Citizenship: Original Birth Certificate,       Certified Copy of a Birth Certificate, or a U.S. Passport</li>
    <li>Social Security       Card </li>
    <li>Driver’s License </li>
    <li>Contact       Information Sheet </li>
    <li>Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing       (E-QIP), which is the electronic version of the Standard Form 86 (SF 86).</li>
    <li>Electronic Finger Print <em>(UCF Office of Facility Security is able to capture and submit to Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC))</em></li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong>Electronic Questionnaire for  Investigations Processing (e-QIP)</strong></h3>
  <p> The Electronic Questionnaire for  Investigations Processing (e-QIP) is essentially an electronic online version  of the Standard Form 86. Once we have received all the items listed above you  will be given instructions how to complete the Standard Form 86. This includes  the URL website address, e-QIP Questionnaire Sections Assistance instructions, and  Fingerprinting Service instructions. Additional information on the e-QIP system  is available on the <a href="http://www.opm.gov/e-qip/">Office of Personnel Management</a> website.<br />
  </p>
  <h3><strong>Initial Security Briefing </strong></h3>
  <p> The U.S. Government has granted an  interim clearance, you will be contacted to complete an initial security  briefing. This briefing is required before any access to classified information  or material may be granted and you will be informed of the restrictions  regarding this interim clearance. When your final clearance is later granted,  you will be notified.<br />
    The contract under which you are  working requires access to special access information such as NATO and your <strong>final</strong> clearance has been granted (some areas have expectations), you will be provided  the appropriate briefings for access during the briefing appointment. <br />
  </p>
  <h3><strong>The Standard Form 312</strong></h3>
  <p> Upon completion of the initial security  briefing, you will execute the Classified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement,  Standard Form 312 (SF 312). This will be witnessed by the Facility Security  Officer or Designee Person(s). A copy of the SF 312 will be retained in our office,  a copy is given to the individual, and the original is forwarded to the  Cognizant Security Agency (CSA) for retention. This form is retained for fifty  (50) years beyond the date of your signature. This should indicate to you the  life-long commitment you will be making to protect the classified information  to which you have access.<br />
  </p>
  <h3><strong>Maintaining Your Personnel Security  Clearance</strong></h3>
  <p> Once you are briefed as a cleared  employee, you have certain responsibilities. These are outlined in the Cleared  Employees Reporting Requirements, a copy of which was provided to you at your  initial security briefing. These responsibilities include, but are not limited  to, certain reporting requirements, the annual refresher briefing, and a  periodic reinvestigation.<br />
  </p>
  <h3><strong>Annual Refresher Briefing</strong></h3>
  <p> The UCF Office of Facility Security is  required to provide annual refresher training to all cleared employees. As a  cleared employee, you must complete this annual training as one way in which  you demonstrate a continuing need for the clearance. <strong>This requirement is mandatory.</strong> <br />
  </p>
  <h3><strong>Periodic Reinvestigations</strong></h3>
  <p> As a cleared UCF employee, you will be  asked to complete an updated copy of the Electronic Questionnaire for  Investigations Processing (e-QIP) approximately once every (10) ten years for a  SECRET clearance, every (5) five years for a TOP SECRET clearance. This is a  routine periodic reinvestigation. We will contact you and request that you  complete an updated e-QIP Questionnaire.<br />
    A copy of your last SF86 may be of help  to you in completing the new e-QIP.&nbsp; The UCF Office of Facility Security  cannot retain copies of cleared UCF employees’ e-QIP.<br />
  </p>
  <h3><strong>Visit Authorization Requests</strong></h3>
  <p> For Visit Authorization Requests see  &quot;Visit Authorization Letters&quot; tab above.<br />
  </p>
  <h3><strong>Terminating Employment at UCF and/or  Your Personnel Security Clearance</strong></h3>
  <p> If you terminate employment with UCF by  discharge,  resignation, or retirement or if the classified contract under  which your clearance was obtained ends and the likelihood of your obtaining  another classified contract in the near future is uncertain, your security  clearance must be terminated<a href="Contact.html">. Contact us</a> to make an appointment for a debriefing.&nbsp; If your security clearance is  terminated and you are assigned to another contract or obtain different  employment for which a clearance is required within 24 months of your original  clearance termination date, your clearance can be reinstated quickly.</p>
